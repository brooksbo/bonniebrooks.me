##### About

If you are a data visualization fan or practitioner who also uses python you may have heard of Jake Vanderplas and Brian Granger's `altair`: _'a declarative statistical visualization library for Python, based on Vega and Vega-lite'._ _With Altair, you can spend more time understanding your data and its meaning. Altair’s API is simple, friendly and consistent and built on top of the powerful Vega-Lite visualization grammar. This elegant simplicity produces beautiful and effective visualizations with a minimal amount of code._ In this piece we’ll be digging deeper into one of `altair`'s less known features: themes."

##### Description

**What are altair themes?**

A theme, in altair, is a set of chart configurations applied globally each python session. This means you can produce similar-looking visualizations consistently.
Why would that be useful?

Maybe you are working on developing a personal style for your blog or maybe you are part of a company that already has a style in place or maybe you hate gridlines and are tired of turning them off every single time you create a chart. Having a style guide to follow is always a benefit when you are producing data visualizations.

Rather than explaining the value of style-guides and consistency in your visualizations, in this article we will explore how to implement one in altair by recreating the [Urban Institute's Data Visualization Style Guide](http://urbaninstitute.github.io/graphics-styleguide/).
