##### About

"In this report, a follow-up to our earlier statistical portrait of developmental education, we analyze two new reforms in developmental math, known as statistics pathways and compressed math pathways. We utilize various regression techniques to estimate the effect of statistics pathways and compression math pathways on studentsâ€™ course success, primarily probit and ordinary least squares (OLS) fixed-effects regressions."
