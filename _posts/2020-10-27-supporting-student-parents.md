##### About

"This report examines the role California’s community colleges play in building
skills and credentials to support the economic mobility of CalWORKs parents. We
examine the trajectories of more than 43,000 students who received CalWORKs
cash assistance and services from a college CalWORKs program between the
school years 2012–13 and 2018–19. We also surveyed CalWORKs program
directors at community colleges to learn more about the programs and services
they provide to students."
