##### About

###### Python for Data Analysis and Visualization

The National Center for Education Statistics, through the Integrated Post-secondary Education Data System (IPEDS) provides publicly available institutional-level data for higher education institutions across the United States. This presentation will use this data to illustrate a typical data analysis workflow utilizing cutting-edge technologies. This presentation will also be about sharing data visualization learning resources (online and physical) so that participants can learn how to learnabout effective data analysis and visualization. This presentation will go over the benefits of using Jupyter as your working environment.
"The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text."

Jupyter Notebooks are becoming more and more commonplace across many industries and have revolutionized the way practitioners analyze and report data (i.e. The Atlantic's "The Scientific Paper is Obsolete. Here's What's Next." https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/) but this has not been the case in the educational research world. This presentation will go over ways to learn how to use Jupyter Notebooks to save time and energy when analyzing and visualizing data.

Participants will also learn about the vast amount of resources, both online and physical, available to them. These resources include websites, blogs, tools, and publications, dedicated to teaching effective data visualization and analysis techniques, best practices, and learning communities for practitioners of all levels.

This presentation will be a demonstration of a typical data analysis project step by step. It will go from acquiring the data from IPEDS and loading and manipulating it into a focused working dataset to developing an interactive visualization. This visualization will be ready to be shared with stakeholders as a tool to explore or embedded on a website.
